<h2>{{ page.title }}</h2>

<p>Date and time formats are specified as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime">ISO8601</a> compatible strings, both for time points as well as for intervals and durations.</p>

<p>An optionally required granularity may be specified as part of the respective
attributes' documentations.</p>

#### Units of time

* *Y* = year
* *M* = month
* *D* = day
* *H* = hour
* *M* = minute
* *S* = second
* *.S* = decimal fraction of a second

#### Time points

The specification of a time point is given through the concatenation of

* a date in YYYY-MM-DD
* the designator "T" indicating a following time description
* the time of day in HH:MM:SS.SSS form, where "SSS" represents a decimal
  fraction of a second
* a time zone offset in relation to UTC

**Examples**

* year (YYYY)
    - *2015*
    - Time points with *year* granularity are both common for obfuscated personal data as well as technical metadata (e.g. year of publication of an analysis).

* date (e.g. date of birth) in YYYY-MM-DD
    - *2015-02-10*
    - This represents the standard way of representing a specific day, e.g. a date of birth.

* time stamp in milliseconds in YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSS
    - *2015-02-10T00:03:42.123Z*
    - Timepoints with millisecond granularity are typical use cases for timing computer generated entries, e.g. the time of a record's update ("updateTime").

**Implementations**

* updated (ubiquitous object time stamp)
* created (ubiquitous object time stamp)


#### Durations

Durations are the most common form of time intervals. They do not refer to
(e.g. start or end) time points.
They are indicated with a leading "P", followed by unit delimited
quantifiers. A leading "T" is required before the start of the time components.
Durations do not have to be normalized; "PT50H" is equally valid as "P2T2H".
A frequent use of durations in biomedical data resources are *age* values,
e.g. "age at diagnosis"; but also "progression free survival", "followup" or "time to recurrence" (these are descriptive labels, which do not necessarily represent GA4GH schema use).

**Examples**

* age in years in PnY
    - *P44Y*
    - This would be the standard annotation for the commonly used age in years, without relation to a date of birth.

* age in years and months in PnYnM
    - *P43Y08M*
    - This represents an age with added months specification.

* short time interval (e.g. 30min in experimental time series) in PTnM
    - *PT30M*
    - A common use for durations is the recording of time points in time series,
      e.g. experimental interventions and observations (collections of cells from
      an in vitro treatment experiment; recurring drug doses in a chemotherapy
      treatment).

#### Time intervals

Time intervals consist of a combination of two time designators. These can be
either two time points for start and end, or one time point and a leading
(time point indicates end) or trailing (time point indicates start) duration.
The time elements are separated by a forward slash "/".

While such anchored time intervals represent an option to capture different time features in a single value and to avoid disconnected references, in the context of the data schema, *anchored intervals* will presumably be used less frequently, with a qualitative anchor ("date of diagnosis", "time of sampling") representing the point of reference.


**Examples**

* age with date of birth in YYYY-MM-DD/PnYnMnD
    - 1967-11-21/P40Y10M05D
    - This value captures both the date of birth (here November 21, 1967)and the age (here 40ys, 10 months and 5 days) at a given time point, e.g. at the date of a medical diagnosis.

* anchored 3 month interval, e.g. a therapy cycle in YYYY-MM-DD/YYYY-MM-DD
    - 2015-04-18/2015-07-17
    - This example demonstrates use of an calendar anchored interval, with given start and end date. A typical example would be the use in medical records, e.g. for a treatment cycle; however, use for data exchange and mining purposes would be less common and usually served with a "duration" (see above).

* experimental intervention of 30min in YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM/PTnM
    - 2014-12-31T23H45M/PT30M
    - Here is an example for a short term intervention of a 30 minutes duration, e.g. the celebratory exposure to a diluted sample of EtOH with various organic trace compounds, to celebrate the arrival of the new year.
