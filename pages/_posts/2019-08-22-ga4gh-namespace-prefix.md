## {{ page.title }}

In a "GA4GH Namespace Discussion" telecon on 2019-08-22, initiated by GKS and with the participation of different work stream and project leads, it was agreed that newly generated identifiers created and maintained in the "GA4GH ecosystem" should use a general `ga4gh` prefix, and __not__ create scoped prefixes.

For more information about CURIEs and their use in GA4GH schemas please visit the ["identifiers and CURIEs" page](/standards/identifiers-curies.html).
