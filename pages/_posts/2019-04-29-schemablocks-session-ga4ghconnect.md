## {{ page.title }}

During the first day of the 2019 GA4GHconnect meeting we had an open discussion session about the perceived need and future directions of the __{S}[B]__ initiative. The [slides](/pdf/2019-04-29___Courtot-and-Baudis__SB-discussion__slides.pdf) used in the discussion recapitulate some of the reasoning and open questions related to {S}[B].

#### Take-aways from the Meeting

Peter Goodhand suggested to proceed over the next months, to work on the content & format of {S}[B], and use the next GA4GH steering committee call (September 2019) to present the project, for a discussion of a possible integration into the overall GA4GH strategy / roadmap.

#### Next Steps

* establish a meeting schedule & reach out to participants
* create a "3 level" schema of quality levels, e.g.
    - approved standard (used by GA4GH products after approval process)
    - external, accepted standard
    - playground
* convert existing schema examples to JSON Schema
    - documentation pages from available tools (?) and additionally adapted custom scripting (i.e. modification of current Perl tool) for website
