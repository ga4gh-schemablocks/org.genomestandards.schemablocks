## {{ page.title }}

SchemaBlocks schemas ("blocks") provide recommended blueprints for schema parts
to be re-used for the development of code based "products" throughout the GA4GH
ecosystem. We propose a labeling system for those schemas, to provide
transparency about the level of support those schemas have from {S}[B]
participants and observers.

#### Proposed {S}[B] Status Levels

The current status level of thiose recommendations is "proposed".

* `playground`
	- early development or import stage, of any quality
	- no recommendation; existence does not mean any current or future
	{S}[B] support
* `community`
	- reserved for schemas from GA4GH community contributors which are used in production (i.e. not individual ideas or concepts)
	- not recommended for direct integration into products
	- can serve as use-case based demonstrators and inspire GA44GH project modifications
* `proposed`
	- at least some {S}[B] contributors are in favour of such a block
	- the code may undergo considerable maturation
	- not recommended for integration into products w/o close tracking
	- contributions and discussions are encouraged
* `implemented`
	- mature block which is implemented in one or more {S}[B] aligned
	schemas
	- may be extended from a core block or be too specific for general
	("core") usability
* `core`
	- a schema block with recommended use
	- stable through minor version changes
	- has to be used in at least 2 standards/products approved by the GA4GH Steering Committee
