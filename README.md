#### Website repository of the [GA4GH SchemaBlocks Project](http://schemablocks.org)

This repository contains documentation and general information pages of the SchemaBlocks project:

* standard pages and general standards documenation and discussion is added and edited in this project, in the different collections in the [__pages__](./pages/) directory
* documentation of schema "blocks" is rendered from the inline documentation in the schema files into the [__pages/\_schemas__](./pages/_schemas/) directory

The source files in this project are auto-generated into the website through Github's "Jekyll" system. The website uses the [template](https://github.com/progenetix/progenetix-site-template) from the Progenetix project.

The rendered website is accessible as [schemablocks.org](http://schemablocks.org).
